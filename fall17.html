    <h1>HEATING UP</h1>
    <figure>
      THE FALL 2017 CAPSULE COLLECTION WAS INSPIRED BY THE MONTREAL YOUTH CULTURAL SCENE THAT I GREW UP ENJOYING.
      MY INITIAL IDEA WAS TO SHOOT IN A DEPANNEUR BUT IT WAS NOT EASY TO COORDINATE. SHOOTING IN A LAUNDROMAT, OVERNIGHT,
      WAS THE NEXT BEST THING. THE IDEA WAS TO CAPTURE RAW, FILM QUALITY SHOTS, OF SOME KIDS WEARING THE NEW
      MAGNOLIA ROAD SHIRTS AND TUQUES, WHILE DOING WHAT YOUTH DOES BEST, HANGING OUT, IN A 24HR LAUNDROMAT.

      <figure class="ptext"><h2>PROCESS</h2>
      <P>I had designed two long sleeve and two short sleeve graphic t-shirts to be released with three embroidered tuques for a fall capsule collection. The graphic that I designed for the shirts was my logo flower, on fire. The logo was to communicate the brand that was taking off and "catching heat" in the city. Winter was also approaching so I wanted to present something fun and playfull during the cold months to come.</P>
      <P>Next came the process of making the shirt and tuque mock-ups for my manufacturers, and to choose the proper fabrics and colors.</P>
      <P>Once that was finalized, I had to organize the lookbook shoot. I found a female and male model to portray a young couple, hanging around Montreal, during a cold night. I came across a 24hr laundromat which was right in the heart of the city. Finally, I contacted a great photographer that shot eclusively on film, and the rest was just a matter of styling and directing the models to fit the scene.</P></figure>
