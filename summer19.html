    <h1>LONELY ROADS</h1>
    <figure>
      SUMMER 2019 WAS MY FIRST COLLECTION OF CUT & SEWN GARMENTS. THE TITLE "LONELY ROADS" WAS INSPIRED BY MONTREAL LANDSCAPING COMPANIES AND MAGNOLIA ROADS CONCEPT OF PAVING YOUR OWN ROAD IN LIFE. MONTREAL ALSO HAS A BIG MARKET FOR LANDSCAPING COMPANIES, MY FAMILY HAVING STARTED IN LANDSCAPING AND WORKING THEIR WAY UP INTO ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE.

      <figure class="ptext"><h2>PROCESS</h2>
        <P>Leading up to summer 2019, I had just completed an internship at a Montreal clothing brand, and in the process had learned about garment production (sourcing, sewing, pattern making etc). I teamed up with a local sewer to design a  heavy weight short and hoodie combination. I designed a heavy-weight wool hoodie, with cargo pockets on the sleeves. That was accompanied by a pair of drop-crotch pleated wool shorts. I also designed the same hoodie set but in a heavy cotton jersey material, to be screen printed on. To complete the collection, I added five long sleeve screen printed shirts.</P>
        <P>When it came to the lookbook, I wanted to keep it very simple and clean, placing more emphasis on the clothing. I casted my good friend and my cousin as models, and teamed up with a photographer, newly graduated from Concordia University.</P></figure>
